# ear-blaster
Ear Blaster: a lightweight, Qt-based soundboard with customizable keybinds.

## WARNING:
This project is a **work in progress** - expect missing features, bugs, and many changes.

## Future plans:
### New sound system:
- play multiple audio tracks at once
- stop one song while others are still playing
- stop every song at once (button and keybind)
- realtime microphone input (mixed with played audio)
- separate volume for the microphone input
- playing to multiple audio outputs at once (e.g. virtual in and main headphones)
- separate volume for every output device
- realtime overdrive mode (more than 100% volume)
- main volume control
- signal when the song ends
- signal if playing the song fails
- mp3 and wav support (maybe more if possible)
